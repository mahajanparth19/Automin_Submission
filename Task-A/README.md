## Task A

<h2> Fine Tuning The Model </h2>
Use the Model.py file to create the fine Tuned model.
For this the data should be inside Files/train and dev folders.

Inside Files, train and dev should contain the folders for each transcript and minutes pair (Just like the Sample Folder). The file to be used as transcript should have "transcript" in name and similarly for minutes the file should contain the word "minutes"

This will create the an Model folder which will have the Fine Tuned Model. 

<h2> Summarization </h2>
Use the Output.py to generate summaries.
For this the files are fetched from Files/test and in this there should be seperate folder for each transcript file.
The output will be generated in Output folder

<h4> Use the drive link to get the fine tuned model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fw8vz7aunm-JwWrn-gMydc3Z-oFsh5Q1/view?usp=sharing </h4>
